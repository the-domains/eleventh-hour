The back-to-back parties, the bowls of candy and plates of cookies, and how about a cup of eggnog? With so many temptations, the holidays are a major challenge for those of us trying to watch our weight. Sadly, most of us will gain at least three pounds during the holidays. Is there a way to avoid this holiday weight gain?</p><p>YES, there is! Here are some healthy suggestions to help YOU avoid that holiday bulge. It’s a two-pronged approach with two basic concepts. First, you need to make healthier choices and do your best to avoid the “calorie bombs”. And secondly, increase your activity level to burn those extra holiday calories.</p><p><b>Phase 1 - Limit Temptations and Calories</b></p><p><b>Mindset.</b></p><p> It all starts with mindset. You’re probably a normally fit and healthy person, but during the holiday season you must shift from your normal healthy eating and fitness routine to DEFENSE mode. Your mindset during the holidays should be “I will NOT let myself GAIN weight!” Read on…</p><p><b>Healthy Choices.</b></p><p> During the endless parties and family gatherings, when faced with an endless buffet of holiday treats, try to fill your plate with a few healthier choices. Choose soups, fresh salads, lots of vegetables, and some lean proteins and seafood. Fill your plate (and your stomach) with healthy food choices and leave only a</p><p>little room for those holiday “calorie bombs”.</p><p><b>Drink Water.</b></p><p> Drinking more water is always a good idea, no matter what time of year. But during the holidays, those colas, eggnogs, and party alcohol contain hundreds of calories EACH. A few cups of eggnog can easily add up to a thousand EXTRA calories. Drink water instead. If you must have a “drink” in your hand at that office party, try sparkling water with some cranberry juice and a cherry or similar garnish. It will look like a cocktail with virtually NO calories!</p><p><b>Make Friends. </b></p><p>And develop a support system. Have you noticed that healthy people tend to congregate at parties and gatherings? Find people who understand and support your need to stay strong and lean during the holidays. Stay away from the friends and relatives who are always pushing food and drinks at you! “Have another piece of pie…” Don’t let them force feed you, politely say no and regroup with your healthy circle of friends.</p><p><b>Phase 2 - Limit The Damage</b></p><p><b>Holiday Fat Burning.</b></p><p> You’ve done your best to avoid excess calories and weight gain at those parties and family feasts, but some weight gain is unavoidable no matter how strong your mindset and willpower. So what now? Just sit back and feel sorry for yourself? No, of course not. Become a holiday fat burning machine. If the holidays cause you to eat and drink more calories, find a way to burn more calories. Everything we do burns some calories, why not build on that to burn holiday fat with holiday activities? I am not talking about a leisurely stroll through the mall while Christmas shopping, this would do little for you, especially if you ate an EXTRA three thousand calories last night.</p><p>No, you need short periods of </p><p> activity to burn those holiday calories and fat even after you stop exercising. Shoot for at least 10 minutes of intense exercise to reach your training (fat-burning) zone. Here are a few examples:</p><p>Find the most difficult and challenging way to get to the next party. is that office party on the 15th floor of your office building? Then climb the stairs to get there. Don’t just casually stroll up the stairs...CLIMB the stairs at a brisk heart-racing pace.</p><p>Always park your car on the top level of the garage at work or while shopping. Use the stairs and NOT the elevator. You can create a circuit by shuttling your purchases up the stairs, locking them in your vehicle, jogging back down the stairs to start the process over. No garage available? Park at the most distant section of the parking lot.</p><p>Staying with friends or relatives over the holidays? Offer to shovel the snow - every day. Make it more challenging each time you do by trying to do it more quickly each day.</p><p>Watching your favorite football game or soccer match with friends or family? Challenge everyone involved to a variety of exercise contests when your team (or theirs) scores - similar to a drinking game but with exercises like pushups instead.</p><p>Treat every holiday event or chore as an opportunity to push yourself and reach that short but intense target training zone and burn those extra holiday calories and fat!</p><picture>
